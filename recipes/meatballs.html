    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 to 1.25 pounds lean ground turkey</li>
      <li>½ small onion, grated (or very finely chopped)</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup unseasoned breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat Air Fryer if it requires pre-heating.</li>
      <li>Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl until combined. Be careful not to overmix. I usually start with a fork to get things somewhat combined and then use my hands to gently mix it all together well</li>
      <li>Shape into 1-inch round meatballs.</li>
      <li>Working in batches so as to not overcrowd the Air Fryer, place meatballs in the Air Fryer tray with a little space between each one for even cooking.</li>
      <li>Cook at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes, until cooked through. Repeat with the remaining meatballs. (Cooked meatballs can be kept warm by placing them on a plate lightly tented with foil or placing them on a baking sheet in an oven at 250 degrees F.) Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
